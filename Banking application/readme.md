Date : 23.10.2024 Case Study : Banking Application Problem: A bank is developing an application where users can transfer funds between accounts. The program needs to handle various exceptions to prevent issues like transferring more money than the available balance, or entering an invalid account number.

Custom exception handling for: • Insufficient Funds: Raised a custom exception when the transfer amount exceeds the balance. • Invalid Account Number: Handled invalid account formats by catching a ValueError.

Case Study: Banking Application Problem Statement: A bank is developing an application to facilitate fund transfers between user accounts. The application needs robust exception handling to prevent issues such as transferring more money than available in the account or entering invalid account numbers.

Objectives: Implement custom exception handling for:

Insufficient Funds: Raise a custom exception when the transfer amount exceeds the available balance.

Invalid Account Number: Handle invalid account formats by catching a ValueError.

Requirements: Fetch account details from a dummy file.

Perform fund transfers between accounts with exception handling.

Implementation: Custom Exceptions First, we define custom exceptions to handle specific error cases:

Dummy File: We create a dummy file (accounts.txt) to simulate account data:
